    role: Undergraduate ML Researcher
    description:
      - Developing method for decoupled bias reduction in Vision-Language Models by transforming representation vectors, reduced performance gap by 30% and lowered computational/training costs by 100x compared to current literature
      - Implementing tests for task-transferability for review of dozens of extant debiasing techniques in vision language models
    date: May 2024 - Ongoing
  - title: Class Technologies
    role: Data Science and Visualization Specialist
    description: 
      - Redesigned videoconferencing breakout room dashboard to reduce cpu utilization and bandwidth by factor of 1000, implementing language model to flag harassment and visualize activity in each breakout
      - Designed & implemented new data portal using React and Python for instructors to predict which students are at risk

  - title: MIT Darwin Project
    role: Bioinformatics Data Scientist
    description: 
      - Used R and Python on a high-performance computing cluster to analyze and visualize omics data and perform clustering 
      - Modified orthogroup clustering software written in Python, resulting in >3x speed-up
      - Verified differential-equation-based cellular model in Julia & developed ML model to predict variation from transcriptome
  - title: The Works, Inc.
    role: Data Scientist
    description: 
      - Used Python, R, & Google Sheets to speed up eviction geocoding 10x, and analyze data to classify 100,000+ retaliatory evictions 
      - Created interactive maps/visualizations of retaliatory evictions using QGIS and ArcGIS StoryMaps, collaborating w/ team of 7
      - Successfully used QGIS, Tableau, and R to create visualizations convincing city to give additional $4 million in eviction aid
    date: Aug. 2023 – Feb. 2024
